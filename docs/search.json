    "text": "Q3.1\nWrite a function that will generate and return a random sample of size \\(n\\) from the two-parameter exponential distribution Exp(\\(\\lambda\\),\\(\\eta\\)) for arbitrary \\(n\\), \\(\\lambda\\), and \\(\\eta\\). (See Examples 2.3 and 2.6.) Generate a large sample from Exp(\\(\\lambda\\),\\(\\eta\\)) and compare your sample quantiles with the theoretical quantiles.\n\n\nQ3.2\nThe standard Lapace distribution has density \\(f(x) = \\frac{1}{2}e^{-\\vert x \\vert}\\) for \\(x \\in \\mathbb{R}\\). Use the inverse transform method to generate a random sample of size 1000 from this distribution. Use one of the methods shown in this chapter to compare the generated sample to the target distribution.\n\n\nQ3.3\nThe Pareto(\\(a\\), \\(b\\)) distribution has cdf\n\\[ F(x) = 1 -  \\left(\\frac{b}{x}\\right)^a, \\hspace{1em} x \\ge b &gt; 0, \\; a &gt; 0 \\]\nDerive the probability inverse transformation \\(F^{-1}(U)\\) and use the inverse transform method to simulate a random sample from the Pareto(2,2) distribution. Graph the density histogram of the sample with the Pareto(2,2) density superimposed for comparison.\n\n\nQ3.4\nThe Rayleigh density is\n\\[ f(x) = \\frac{x}{\\sigma^2}e^{-x^2/(2\\sigma^2)}, \\hspace{1em} x \\ge 0, \\; \\sigma &gt; 0 \\]\nDevelop an algorithm to generate random samples from a Rayleigh(\\(\\sigma\\)) distribution. Generate Rayleigh(\\(\\sigma\\)) samples for several choices of \\(\\sigma &gt; 0\\) and check that the mode of the generated samples is close to the theoretical mode \\(\\sigma\\) (check the histogram).\n\n\nQ3.5\nA discrete random variable \\(X\\) has probability mass function\n[insert table]\nUse the inverse transform method to generate a random sample of size 1000 from the distribution of \\(X\\). Construct a relative frequency table and compare the empirical with the theoretical probabilities.

The components of the mixture have \\(N(0,1)\\) and \\(N(3,1)\\) distributions with mixing probabilities \\(p_1\\) and \\(p_2 = 1 - p_1\\). Graph the histogram of the sample with density superimposed, for \\(p_1 = 0.75\\). Repeat with different values for \\(p_1\\) and observe whether the empirical distribution of the mixture appears to be bimodal. Make a conjecture about the values of \\(p_1\\) that produce bimodal mixtures.\n\n\nQ3.12\nSimulate a continuous Exponential-Gamma mixture. Suppose that the rate parameter \\(\\Lambda\\) has Gamma(\\(r\\), \\(\\beta\\)) distribution and \\(Y\\) has Exp(\\(\\Lambda\\)) distribution. That is, \\((Y \\vert \\Lambda = \\lambda) \\sim f_Y(y \\vert \\lambda) = \\lambda e^{-\\lambda y}\\). Generate 1000 random observations from this mixture with \\(r=4\\) and \\(\\beta=2\\)\n\n\nQ3.13\nIt can be shown that the mixture in Exercise 3.12 has a Pareto distibution with cdf\n\\[ F(y) = 1 - \\left( \\frac{\\beta}{\\beta + y} \\right)^r, \\hspace{1em} y \\ge 0\\]\n(This is an alternative parameterization of the Paredo dcf given in Exercise 3.3.) Generate 1000 random observations from the mixture with \\(r=4\\) and \\(\\beta = 2\\).

Use the R pairs plot to graph an arrach of scatter plots for each pair of variables. For each pair of variables (visually) check that the location and correlation approximately agree with the theoretical parameters of the correponding bivariate normal distribution.\n\n\nQ3.15\nWrite a function that will standardize a multivariate normal sample for arbitrary \\(n\\) and \\(d\\). That is, transform the sample so that the sample mean vectore is zero and sample covariance is the identity matrix. To check your results, generate multivariate normal samples and print the sample mean vector and covariance matrix before and after standardization.\n\n\nQ3.16\nEfron and Tibshirani discuss the scor (bootstrap) test score data on 88 students who took examizations in five subjects. Each row of the data frame is a set of scores \\((x_{i1}, \\ldots, x_{i5})\\) for the \\(i^{th}\\) student. Standardize the scores by type of exam. That is, standardize the bivariate samples (\\(X_1, X_2\\)) (closed book) and the trivariate samples (\\(X_3, X_4, X_5\\)) (open book). Compute the covariance matrix of the transformed sample of test scores.\n\n\nQ3.17\nCompare the performance of the Beta generator of Exercise 3.7, Example 3.8, and the R generator rbeta. Fix the parameters \\(a=2\\), \\(b=2\\) and time each generator of 1000 iterations with sample size 5000. (See Example 3.19.) Are the results different for different choices of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\)?\n\n\nQ3.18\nWrite a function to generate a random sample from a \\(W_d(\\Sigma,n)\\) (Wishart) distribution for \\(n &gt; d+1 \\ge 1\\), based on Bartlett’s decomposition.",
